#### the task at hand
each assignment we do i get better and better at, currently running into a problem with my for loops i lack confidence and dont want to spend any wasted time on learning them untill I get to the weekend. I wont make the mistake this time and going foward to not focus on something thats not working or a concept I can't grasp, and focus on the ones I do. What ever free time during the week after i finish an assignment will be used as study time so the future task I post, get simipler to read, and write.
